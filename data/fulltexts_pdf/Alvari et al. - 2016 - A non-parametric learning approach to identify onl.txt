Abstract—Human trafficking is among the most
challenging
law enforcement problems which demands persistent fight against
from all
over
the
globe.
In this
study,
we
leverage
readily
available data from the website “Backpage”– used for classified
advertisement– to discern potential patterns of human trafficking
activities which manifest online and identify most likely traffick-
ing related advertisements.
Due to the lack of
ground truth,
we rely on two human analysts –one human trafficking victim
survivor and one from law enforcement,
for hand-labeling the
small
portion of
the crawled data.
We then present
a semi-
supervised learning approach that
is
trained on the available
labeled and unlabeled data and evaluated on unseen data with
further verification of experts.

NTRODUCTION
Human trafficking has received increased national
and so-
cietal
concern over
the past
decade [1].
According to the
United Nation [2], human trafficking is defined as the modern
slavery or
the trade of
humans
mostly for
the purpose of
sexual exploiting and forced labor, via different improper ways
including force,
fraud and deception.
Human trafficking is
among the challenging problems facing the law enforcement–
it is difficult to identify victims and counter traffickers.
Before the advent of the Internet, pimps were under the risks
of being arrested by law enforcement,
while advertising their
victims on the streets [3].
However,
the move to the Internet,
has made it easier and less dangerous for both sex buyers and
sellers,
especially for the pimps [4] as they no longer needed
to advertise on the streets. There are now plethora of websites
that
host
and provide sexual
services,
under
categories
of
escort, adult entertainment, massage services, etc., which help
pimps,
traffickers and sex buyers (a.k.a.
“johns”),
maintain
their
anonymity.
Though some services
such as
Craiglist’s
adult
section and myredbook.com were shut
down recently,
still
there
are
many websites
such as
Backpage.com that
provide such services and many new are frequently created.
Traffickers even use dating and social
networking websites,
including Twitter,
Facebook,
Instagram and Tinder
to reach
out
to the johns and their other followers.
Although Internet
has presented new trafficking related challenges for law en-
forcement,
it has also provided readily and publicly available
rich source of information which could be gleaned from online
sex advertisements for fighting this crime [5].
Although, the Internet is being used for many other activities
including attracting the
victims,
communicating with cos-
tumers and rating the escort services, here we only focus on the
online advertisements. In this study, we use data crawled from
the adult
entertainment
section of the website Backpage.com
and propose a non-parametric learning approach to identify the
most likely human trafficking related online advertisements out
of the escort
advertisements.
To the best
of our knowledge,
this
is
the first
study that
employs
both data mining and
semi-supervised machine learning techniques to identify the
potential
human trafficking related advertisements given only
a small
portion of labeled data.
We thus make the following
contributions.
1)
We collected real posts from the U.S.
cities represented
on Backpage.com.
The data was then preprocessed and
cleaned.
2)
Based on the
literature,
we
created different
groups
of
features that
capture the characteristics of
potential
human trafficking activities.
The less likely human traf-
ficking related posts were then filtered out
using these
features.
3)
Due to the lack of
ground truth,
we relied on human
analysts for hand-labeling small
portion of the filtered
data.
4)
We trained a semi-supervised learner
on labeled and
unlabeled data and sent
back the identified highly hu-
man trafficking related advertisements to the experts for
further verification.
We then validated our approach on
unseen data with further verification of experts.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section II,
we briefly provide the background of the problem of human
trafficking.
Next,
we review the prior studies on human traf-
ficking in Section III. Then in Section IV, we explain our data
preparation and feature extraction scheme.
Our unsupervised
filtering and expert assisted labeling are explained in Sections
V and VI, respectively. We detail our non-parametric learning
approach in Sections VII. We conclude the paper by providing
future research directions in Section VIII.

The United States’
Trafficking Victim Protection Act
of
2000 (TVPA 2000) [6],
was the first
U.S.
legislation passed
arXiv:1607.08691v2 [cs.LG] 2 Aug 2016
against
human trafficking.
According to TVPA 2000,
sex
trafficking is a severe form of trafficking,
where force,
fraud
or
corecion are primary ways
of
inducing commercial
sex
act.
Human Trafficking is a crime against
humanity and is
one of
the most
atrocious crimes of
global
magnitude.
It
is
a $150 billion industry of exploitation of children and young
adults,
utilizing humans for forced labor and sex trafficking
worldwide.
No country is immune and the problem is rapidly
growing with little to no law enforcement addressing the issue
and approximately 161 countries affected.
Human trafficking
is considered to be a form of
modern day slavery.
Humans
are controlled,
exploited,
abused,
forced into prostitution and
labor
of
servitude in some form and all
under
the threat
of
punishment if they do not perform their required duties.
The Find Me Group (FMG) was founded by retired DEA
Special
Agent
Jerry “Kelly”
Snyder
in 2002 primarily to
locate missing persons.
The natural
evolution of
the group
in locating missing persons
was
to allocate
resources
for
locating victims in human trafficking,
as well
as identifying
the persons responsible and reporting these organizations to
law enforcement.
The FMG consists of
current
and retired
law enforcement
agents
and officers
with a wide-range of
investigative expertise, including but not limited to linguistics,
handwriting analysis,
body language,
missing persons
and
homicide.
The search and rescue component
of the FMG is
also comprised of current and retired law enforcement officers
and agents with 28 years of field management skills in locating
missing persons.
The FMG has an additional
advantage by
using trained experts/sources
that
provide detailed location
information of human trafficking victims.
The
ultimate
goal
of
the
current
project
is
to identify
missing persons
which are connected to human trafficking
organizations. This can be done by identifying their locations,
utilizing logistical
methodology with an additional
focus on
their
financial
status and reporting assets to worldwide law
enforcement.

Recently, several studies have examined the role of the Inter-
net and related technology in facilitating human trafficking[7],
[8], [9]. For example, the work of [7] studied how closely sex
trafficking is intertwined with new technologies.
According
to [8],
“The sexual
exploitation of
women and children is
a global
human rights crisis that
is being escalated by the
use of new technologies”.
Researchers have studied the rela-
tionship between new technologies and human trafficking and
advantages of
the Internet
for
sex traffickers.
For
instance,
according to [9],
findings from a group of experts from the
Council
of
Europe
demonstrate
that
the
Internet
and sex
industry are closely interlinked and the volume and content
of
the material
on the Internet
promoting human trafficking
are unprecedented.
One of
the earliest
works
which leveraged data mining
techniques for
online human trafficking was [9],
where the
authors conducted an analysis of
data on the adult
section
of the website Backpage.com.
Their findings confirmed that
the female escort
post
frequency would increase in Dallas,
Texas,
leading up to Super
Bowl
2011 event.
In a similar
attempt,
other studies [10],
[11] have investigated the impact
of large public events such as Super Bowl
on sex trafficking
by exploring advertisement
volume,
trends and movement
of
advertisements along with the scope and volume of demand
associated with such events.
The work of [10],
for instance,
concludes that
in large events like Super Bowl
which attract
significant
amount
of concentration of people in a relatively
short
period of time and in a confined urban area,
could be
a desirable location for sex traffickers to bring their victims
for commercial sexual exploitation.
Similarly,
the data-driven
approach of [11] shows that
in some but
not
all
events,
one
can see a correlation between the occurrence of the event and
statistically significant evidence of an influx of sex trafficking
activity.
Also,
certain studies [12]
have tried to build large
distributed systems to store and process the available online
human trafficking data in order
to perform entity resolution
and create ontological relations between the entities.
Beyond these works, the work of [13], studied the problem
of isolating sources of human trafficking from online advertise-
ments with a pairwise entity resolution approach. Specifically,
they trained a classifier
to predict
if
two ads are from the
same source,
using phone numbers as a strong feature.
Then,
this classifier
was used to perform entity resolution using a
heuristically learned value for the score of classifier.
Another
work of [5] used Backpage.com data and extracted most likely
human trafficking spatio-temporal patterns with the help of law
enforcement.
Note that
unlike our method,
this work did not
employ any machine learning methodologies for automatically
identifying the human trafficking related advertisements.
The
work of [14] also used machine learning techniques by training
a supervised learning classifier on labeled data (based on the
phone numbers of
known traffickers)
provided by a victim
advocacy group, for the ad-classification problem. We note that
while phone numbers can provide very precise set of positive
labeled data,
there are clearly many posts
with previously
unseen phone numbers.
In contrast,
we do not
solely rely on
the phone numbers for labeling the data.
Instead,
our experts
analyze the whole post’s
content
to identify whether
it
is
human trafficking related or
not.
Indeed,
we first
filter
out
the most
likely advertisements using several
feature groups
and pass
a small
sample to the experts
for
hand-labeling.
Then,
we train semi-supervised learner
on both labeled and
unlabeled data which in turn let
us evaluate our approach on
the new coming (unseen) data as well. We note that our semi-
supervised approach can also be used as a complementary
method to procedures such as those described in [14] as we can
significantly expand the training set
for use with supervised
learning.

FFORT
We collected about
20K publicly available listings
from
the U.S.
posted on Backpage.com in March,
2016.
Each post
includes
a title,
description,
time stamp,
the poster’s
age,
poster’s ID,
location,
image,
video and sometimes audio.
The
description usually lists the attributes of the individual(s) and
contact
phone numbers.
In this work we only focus on the
textual
component
of
the data.
This free-text
data required
significant
cleaning due to a variety of
issues
common to
textual analytics (i.e.
misspellings,
format of phone numbers,
etc.).
We also acknowledge that the information in data could
be intentionally inaccurate, such as the poster’s name, age and
even physical appearance (i.e.
bra cup size,
weight).
Figure 1
shows an actual
post
from Backpage.com.
To illustrate the
geographic diversity of
the listings,
we also plot
the phone
distribution with respect
to the different
states in Figure 2.
Note that
for brevity,
we only show those with a frequency
greater than 5.

Next,
we
explain the
most
important
characteristics
of
potential
human trafficking advertisements
captured by our
feature groups.
A.
Feature Engineering
Though many advertisements on Backpage.com are posted
by posters selling their
own services without
coercion and
intervention of
traffickers,
some do exhibit
many common
trafficking triggers. For example, in contrast to the previous ad-
vertisements, Figure 3 shows an advertisement that could be an
evidence of human trafficking. This advertisement has several
potential properties of human trafficking including advertising

for multiple escorts with the first individual coming from Asia
and very young.
In the followings,
we discuss such common
properties of human trafficking related advertisements, in more
details.
Inspired from literature,
we define and extract
6 groups of
features from advertisements,
shown in Table I,
which could
be amongst the strong indicators of the human trafficking.
In
what follows,
we briefly describe each group of features used
in our work. Each feature listed is treated as a binary variable.
1)
Advertisement
Language Pattern:
The first group con-
sists of different
language related features.
For the first
and
second features,
we identify posts
which has
third person
language (more likely to be written by someone other than the
escort) and posts which contain first
person plural
pronouns
such as ‘we’ and ‘our’ (more likely to be an organization) [5].
To ensure their
anonymity,
traffickers would deploy tech-
niques to generate diverse information and hence make their
posts look more complicated. They usually do this to avoid be-
ing identified by either human analyst or automated programs.
Thus,
to obtain the third feature,
we take an approach from
complexity theory,
namely Kolmogorov complexity which is
defined as the length of the shortest program to reproduce the
advertisement content on a universal machine such as Turing
Machine [15]. We approximate the Kolmogorov complexity of
an advertisement’s content,
by simply computing the Entropy
of the content [15] as follows.
Let
X
denote the content and
x
i
be a given word in the content.
We use the following
equation [21] to calculate the Entropy of the content.
H(X) = −
n
X
i=1
P (x
i
) log
2
P (x
i
)
(1)
We
expect
higher
values
of
the
Entropy correspond to
human trafficking.
Finally,
we discretize the result
by using
the threshold of 4 which was found empirically in our exper-
iments.
Next,
we
use
word-level
n-grams
to find the
common
language patterns of the advertisements, as the character-level
n-grams
have
already
shown
to
be
useful
in
detecting
unwanted content
for
Spam detection [16].
We set
n = 4
and compute the normalized n-grams (using TF-IDF) of the
advertisement’s content
and use threshold of 0.5 to binarize
their
values.
This gives us 6 more features to include into
our
feature set.
Overall,
we have 9 features
related to the
language of the advertisement.
2)
Words and Phrases of
Interest:
Despite the fact
that
advertisements
on Backpage.com do not
directly mention
sex with children,
costumers who prefer
children,
know to
look for
words
and phrases
such as
“sweet,
candy,
fresh,
new in town,
new to the game” [17],
[18],
[19].
We thus
investigate within the posts to see if they contain such words as
they could be highly related with human trafficking in general.
3)
Countries
of
Interest:
We identify if
the individual
being escorted is coming from other countries such as those
in Southeast
Asia (especially from China,
Vietnam,
Korea
and Thailand,
as we observed in our data) [1].
4)
Multiple
Victims
Advertised:
Some
advertisements
advertise for multiple women at
the same time.
We consider
the presence of more than one girl as a potential evidence of
organized human trafficking [5].
5)
Victim Weight:
We take into account
weight
of
the
individual
being escorted as
a
feature
(if
it
is
available).
This
information is
particularly useful
assuming that
for
the most
part,
lower body weights (under 110 lbs) correlate
with smaller and underage girls [6],
[20] and thereby human
trafficking.
6)
Reference to Website or Spa Massage Therapy:
The
presence of
a link in the advertisement,
either
referencing
to an outside
website
(especially infamous
ones)
or
spa
massage therapy,
could be an indicator
of
more elaborate
organization [5].
In case of
spa therapy,
we observed many
advertisements interrelated with advertising for young Asian
girls
and their
erotic massage abilities.
Therefore,
the last
group has two binary features for the presence of both website
and spa.
In order to extract these features, we first clean the original
data and conduct preprocessing.
Then we draw 999 instances
out
of
our
dataset
for
further
analysis,
as
they might
be
evidence of human trafficking– this is described in the next
section.

ILTERING
Having detailed our feature set,
we now construct
feature
vectors for
each instance by creating a vector
of
15 binary
features
that
correspond to the important
characteristics
of
human trafficking related posts.
We obtain 999 instances from our dataset
by filtering out
samples that
do not
posses any of
the binary features.
We
will
refer
to this
as
our
filtered dataset.
In Figure 4,
we
visualize
500 of
the
999 samples
and an additional
500
samples outside of the filtered dataset (i.e., from the remainder
of the samples) we studied in a 2-D projection (using the t-
SNE transformation [22]). We clustered the visualized samples
into 2 clusters (using K-means) and found the clusters to be
purely either inside or outside of the sampled data (100% of
samples in cluster 1 were from the identified listings and 100%
of samples in cluster 2 were from outside this group).
Fig.
4.
Two clusters of
a portion of
the filtered data set
combined with
random samples from the remainder of the samples, in the trasformed feature
space.
We then create a second feature space that is used through
the remainder of the paper.
Using Latent
Drichlet
Allocation
(LDA) [23] topic modeling from Python package gensim [24],
we identify 25 most
representative topics out
of the filtered
dataset.
This allows us to uncover the hidden thematic struc-
ture
in the
data.
Further,
we
rely on the
document-topic
distribution given by the LDA (here each document is seen as
a mixture of topics) to distinguish the normal advertisements
(outliers)
from highly human trafficking related ones.
More
specifically, we treat each listing in the filtered data as a vector
of 25 probabilistic values provided by LDA’s document-topic
distribution– this feature space is used in the next step.
Moreover,
since we lack ground truth for our data,
we rely
on human analysts (experts) for labeling the listings as either
human trafficking or
not.
In the next
section,
we select
a
smaller
yet
finer
grain subset
of
this data to be sent
to the
experts. This alleviates the burden of the tedious work of hand-
labeling.

ABELING
We first
obtain a sample of
150 listings from the filtered
dataset. This set of listings was labeled by two human experts:
a previous human trafficking victim and a law enforcement
officer who specialized in this type of crime. From this subset,
a law enforcement
professional
and human trafficking victim
identified 38 and 139 instances (respectively)
to be human
trafficking related instances.
Among them,
there
were
31
records for which both experts agreed were highly related to
human trafficking.
Thus,
we now have 31 confirmed positive
samples,
but
still
have large amounts of unlabeled examples
(849 instances) in our dataset. We summarize the data statistics
in Table II.
Any sample for which at least one expert labeled
as negative,
we treated as a negative sample.

EARNING
We use the Python package scikit-learn [25]
for
training
semi-supervised learner
on the
filtered dataset.
There
are
two label propagation semi-supervised (non-parametric) based
models in this package,
namely,
LabelPropagation and La-
belSpreading [26].
These models
rely on the geometry of
the data induced by both labeled and unlabeled instances as
opposed to the supervised models which only use the labeled
data [26].
This geometry is usually represented by a graph
G = (V, E)
,
with the nodes
V
represent
the training data
and edges
E
represent the similarity between them [26] in the
form of weight matrix W. Given the graph
G
, a basic approach
for semi-supervised learning is through propagating labels on
the graph [26].
Due to the higher performance achieved,
we
chose to use LabelSpreading model. We conducted experiment
with the two built-in kernels radial
basis function (RBF) and
K-nearest
neighbor
(KNN)
in label
propagation models and
report the results in Table III.
Note that we only reported the
precision when 119 negative samples (labeled by either of the
experts) were used in the learning process. We did so because
of the reasonable number of the positive labels assigned by
either of the kernels in presence of these negative instances
(our experts had limited time to validate the labels of the data).
As we see from this table,
out
of 849 unlabeled data,
our
learner with RBF and KNN kernels assigned positive labels
to the 145 and 188 instances,
respectively.
Next,
we pass the
identified positive labels to the experts for further verification.
Our
approach with RBF and KNN correctly identified 134

ONCLUSION
Readily available online data from escort
advertisements
could be leveraged in favor
of
fighting against
the human
trafficking. In this study, having focused on textual information
from available data crawled from Backpage.com,
we iden-
tified if
an escort
advertisement
can be reflective of
human
trafficking activities.
More specifically,
we first
propose an
unsupervised filtering approach to filter
out
the data which
are more likely involved in trafficking.
We then trained a
semi-supervised learner on small
portion of such data,
hand-
labeled by human trafficking experts, to identify the labels for
unseen data. The results suggest our non-parametric approach
is
successful
at
identifying the potential
human trafficking
related advertisements.
In future work we seek to extract the underlying network of
the data to find interesting patterns such as the most influential
nodes as they might indicate the known pimps and traffickers.
We
would also like
to replicate
the
study by integrating
more features,
especially those supported by the criminology
literature.
