Abstract 
Currently users on social media post their opinion and feelings about almost 
everything. This online behavior has led to numerous applications where social media data 
are used to measure public opinion in a similar way as a poll or a survey. In this paper, we 
will present an application of social media mining for the art market. To the best of our 
knowledge, this will be the first attempt to mine social media to extract quantitative and 
qualitative data for the art market. Although there are previous works on analyzing and 
predicting other markets, these methodologies cannot be applied directly to the art market. 
In our proposed methodology, artists will be treated as brands. That is, we will mine Twit-
ter posts that mention specific artists’ names and attempt to rank artists in a similar manner 
as brand equity and awareness would be measured. The particularities of the art market are 
considered mainly in the construction of a topic-specific user network where user expertise 
and influence is evaluated and later used to rank artists. The proposed ranking system is 
evaluated against two other available systems to identify the advantages it can offer.

1 Introduction
Social media users are currently estimated to approximately 2 billion (Statista 2016). The 
content of the posts these users make has been used extensively in applications to quan-
tify the digital reputation economy. Users on social media post their personal opinion and 
feelings about almost everything. On the other hand, almost every business firm from any 
market sector is also present on the social media mainly for the purposes of marketing and 
communicating with their customer base.

This online behaviour has led to numerous applications where social media data are 
used to measure public opinion in a similar way as a poll or a survey. Applications range 
from prediction of an election winner or product sales (Jin et al. 2010), market analysis and 
industry competition (He et al. 2013), prediction of the stock market (Bollen et al. 2011), 
identification of adverse drug reactions (Yang et al. 2012), measurement of brand aware-
ness (Peetz 2015) and brand equity (Culotta and Cutler 2016), to name but a few.
In this paper, we will present an application of social media mining for the art market. 
To the best of our knowledge, this will be the first attempt to mine social media to extract 
quantitative and qualitative data for the art market. Although there are previous works on 
analyzing and predicting other markets, these methodologies cannot be applied directly to 
the art market. As it is stated in Abbing (2002), the economy of the arts is extraordinary. 
The foremost difficulty with the art market is the available data. The sales data from the 
secondary market (i.e. auctions), which some firms collect, are not freely available. How-
ever, when we consider the primary market (i.e. sales from galleries, dealers, etc.) there is 
no data available at all. Another difficulty is that even if there were available price data, 
we could not make estimates based only on the market value of artworks. Artworks as 
products incorporate cultural values that are hard to quantify and estimate. Finally, the art 
world is elitist and certain social groups with higher cultural status or buying power have 
a greater role in structuring the cultural value and in effect the market value of an artwork. 
Consequently, mining the general public opinion cannot be exploited to make estimates for 
the art market.
In our proposed methodology, we will treat artists as brands. That is, we will mine Twit-
ter posts that mention specific artists’ names and we will attempt to rank artists based on 
the inherent cultural value of their works. To achieve this we will work in a similar man-
ner as if we were interested in measuring a brand’s awareness and equity but taking into 
account the particularities of the art market. We will first show how we can build a network 
of users that are influential. These users will be assessed on their expertise and the extent 
in which they participate in the social construction of cultural value. User evaluation will 
then be utilized to weigh the importance of mined tweets to estimate each artist’s ranking. 
Obtained ranking results will be evaluated as trends rather than per se facts for their accu-
racy since there are no data to compare them with. Estimated trends will be correlated with 
other available artist rankings to demonstrate the advantages of our methodology.
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 is a brief review of how 
the art market is organized and establishes the necessity of the proposed application. Sec-
tion 3 presents a literature review of social media data mining applications for other econo-
mies. Sections 4 and 5 detail our methodological approach as well as some key findings. 
Section 6 presents the final artist ranking results and discusses them in depth. Section 7 
concludes with suggestions for future research.
2 The art market
The economy of the arts might be considered exceptional for some scholars (Abbing 2002) 
but for those who are not inside the art world (Danto 1964) it might seem as just odd.
The art world in Becker (1982) is regarded as a network of people: suppliers of materi-
als, distributors of artworks, fellow artists, critics, theorists, and audiences. Works of art 
are produced within this network of people. In Thornton (2008) the art world is seen as 
a “loose network of overlapping subcultures held together by a belief in art”. The most 
412

prominent actors behind the art scenes encompass roles as artists, dealers, curators, critics, 
collectors, and auction-house experts. In general, although at different periods of time the 
notion of who constitutes the art world might vary what remains as a constant is that not 
everybody can participate in the art world. The latter is mostly comprised of certain social 
groups, elites, either due to their higher cultural status or their higher purchasing power.
The elitist nature of the art world and/or the cultural superiority of actors in it, is actu-
ally what makes the economy of arts exceptional mainly in the sense of how prices are 
formed. In most economies prices are determined based on the supply and demand. Not 
surprisingly, this is not the case in the art economy. Certainly, there are also other econo-
mies in which prices are not determined based on the supply and demand. For example, 
in the economy of haute couture the price of a clothing item incorporates a must have 
value mainly due to the high symbolic value directly relevant to the commercial success 
and fame of the designer. Haute couture is accessible only to a certain elite group due to its 
purchasing power. The main distinctive factor of the art economy, when compared to the 
haute couture economy or other luxury product economies, is that an artwork as a product 
conveys for its owner cultural values as well as other values. These conveyed cultural val-
ues make artworks virtually priceless and can lead to astronomical prices.
The study of the economy of the arts started gaining interest during the 90s when prices 
reached excessive levels. A significant number of studies have been published since then 
(Grampp 1989; Velthuis 2007; Thompson 2010; Thornton 2008; Graw 2010; Boll 2011; 
Degen 2013), which attempt to explore the main factors that contribute to the formation of 
artwork prices and are summarized below : 
aesthetic value 
the value of an artwork when appreciated or experienced
social value 
the gained social status by the ownership of an artwork
investment value 
the safety gained from investing in an artwork since prices never drop.
Wealthy people try to find ways to invest their money and art could be a great invest-
ment since the usual practice for living artists is that prices never drop. The statement that 
prices in the art world never drop might initially sound unreasonable or even illegal, as 
it would be in most other economies. However, in the art world there are two kinds of 
markets: 
the primary market 
where artworks are sold for the first time either directly by the art-
ists or by their representatives (e.g. a gallery) and
the secondary market 
where artworks are resold by auction houses.
In the primary market, gallery owners have total control over the price of an artwork. 
The prices are set according to the gallery’s as well the artist’s prestige, status and fame. 
Even in the case where the gallery owner overprices some works of art and they don’t sell, 
prices will not drop. And this is because if prices did drop this would have a negative effect 
in the art world’s perception about the credibility and quality of the gallery as well as the 
artist. As explained in Abbing (2002), it is the persistent beliefs about art and artists that 
ultimately govern the art economy. In later sections of this paper, the use of social media 
mining will be justified as a means for mapping such persistent beliefs about art.
In the case of the secondary market, auction-house experts research previous auction 
data and retail gallery sales to determine a minimum presale estimate price, a reserve price 
and the opening bid amount. These data determine whether a certain artwork will be finally 
413
Inf Retrieval J (2018) 21:410–448 
1 3
auctioned. If it is not almost certain that the artwork will be sold at a desired price it will 
not be auctioned. In almost all cases, artwork prices raise excessively after they enter the 
secondary market. In conclusion, the event of an artwork’s price to drop is highly unlikely 
or even impossible in the way the art economy is structured.
Another significant factor that determines art prices is art’s integrated social value. Art 
has a high symbolic content that is used by art buyers to mark their social status. It is not 
surprising that works of art can be found primarily among wealthy people and institutions. 
In a way, this is one of the causes for the recent phenomenon of star artists. The social 
status gained by the acquisition of an artwork is directly proportional to how recognizable 
the artist’s name is, not necessarily by the general public but at least by the elite of the art 
world. For this reason, we will later propose to treat artist’s names as brands while mining 
social data with the intent to estimate social values.
The discussion in the art world about how the aesthetic value of an artwork is deter-
mined is long and beyond the scope of this paper. In general, today it is concluded that the 
aesthetic value and market value are interdependent. In Velthuis (2007), it is maintained 
that in general higher prices signal to consumers a higher quality (i.e. aesthetic value), 
as it is often the case in other economies as well. Furthermore, today it is accepted that 
experts with high cultural power are the ones who establish the aesthetic value. Moreover, 
in Abbing (2002) it is stated that aesthetic value is in practice a social construction that 
occurs between experts and is related to reputations. Again, we will later show how social 
data can be utilized to identify the social construction of the aesthetic value based on the 
notion of reputations.
To conclude our discussion about the art market, we have identified its basic traits and 
some of the key factors that determine art prices. It is evident, that the actors in the art 
world would have the necessity to have access to art economy data either for pure research 
purposes or to decide what to buy. Following, we will present the major available art mar-
ket information services and later it will be discussed what additional information our pro-
posed methodology can provide.
2.1 Art market information services
The global sales of art in 2015 were estimated to $63.8 billion (Kinsella 2016). Auction 
sales were estimated to the 47% of the total global art sales and the rest 53% to private 
sales (galleries, dealers, etc.). Furthermore, the total revenue of global sales of art was gen-
erated by 38.1 million transactions. The size of the art market dictates involved actors to 
entail services that provide data and analysis before making a decision for a transaction. 
Following, we will describe some of the most popular art market information services.
Artprice (2016) gives access to its subscribers to auction sales data since 1962. They 
also provide the Artprice indicator™ that estimates the potential current value of an art-
work given the amount spent to purchase it at some time in the past. The Art Price Global 
Index measures the total worldwide turnover of auction sales. Finally, Artprice releases 
an annual report for the art market, available also to non-subscribers, where statistics for 
global auction sales are presented as well as a ranking with the top 500 artists by auction 
revenue.
The European Fine Art Foundation (TEFAF) also publishes an annual report with sta-
tistics about the global art market. The TEFAF report does not focus only on auction sales 
as it is the case with the Artprice annual report. It includes data from auctioneers, dealers, 
collectors, industry observers and art sales databases. Consequently, it includes data from 
414
Inf Retrieval J (2018) 21:410–448
1 3
the primary market as well. However, we should note that sales data for the primary market 
are collected with polls to worldwide dealers. There is no available database for the pri-
mary art market sales and although respondents to the poll represent only a fraction of the 
worldwide dealers, the obtained results provide useful insights.
The artnet (2016) is another subscription based service which includes a price database 
of auction results since 1985. Additionally, they offer an Analytics Reports service where 
users can create customized reports to get insights on artists’ auction sales performance 
and artwork price rankings.
Other similar services that provide price databases for auction results are the Blouin Art 
Sales Index (BlouinArtinfo 2016), the ArtNexus (2016) and the FindArtInfo (2016).
What is obvious from the above list of art market information services is that almost all 
of them are dedicated to auctions. However, as it has already been mentioned, the second-
ary market represents approximately only half of the total art market. It is obvious that 
there is a lack of price data for the primary market. This is expected due to its loose struc-
ture and it would be impossible to envisage a price database for sales in galleries, art fairs, 
etc.
Following, we will discuss in more detail Artfacts.Net, an online service that attempts 
to tackle the problem of the lack of price data in the primary market with the utilization of 
the economy of attention. That is, they measure exhibition success instead of sales success.
2.1.1 Artfacts.Net
Artfacts.Net (Artfacts 2016c) is an online subscription service that started in 2001 and 
offers a database, where someone can find information on exhibitions, artists, works of art, 
etc. as well as an artist ranking system.
What differentiates Artfacts.Net from the previously mentioned services is that it is not 
focused on auctions only. The artist ranking system evaluates artists based on their exhibi-
tion success, namely on the economy of attention. The museum’s or gallery’s fame and 
success is in a way transferred to the artist.
Artfacts.Net has in its database 550,406 artist biographies and 33,954 art institutions 
worldwide. At this time, it has listed 2737 current or upcoming exhibitions worldwide. The 
database is updated manually and practically it cannot include everything in the art world 
globally. This is why users have the option to report missing information on artists, exhi-
bitions, galleries and museums. At present, the Artfacts.Net web page states that the last 
database update was over three months ago.
Artfacts.Net ranks almost 100,000 artists (Artfacts 2016b) according to a point sys-
tem. For example, Frank Stella holds the 109th position with 11,530.82 points. Unfortu-
nately, detailed information on how points are awarded is not given. The only information 
available is that points indicate the amount of attention each artist has received from art 
institutions.
Marek Claassen, the director of Artfacts.net, illustrates that awarded points attempt to 
quantify how much embedded an artist is in the international art world (Periferic Biennial 
2008). The number of countries, collections and galleries an artist’s work is exhibited is 
counted, along with the number of solo and group shows. Artists are awarded points equal 
to the exhibition value of the gallery or museum that hosted them. The exhibition value 
raises according to the number of international artist exhibitions the gallery or museum has 
hosted.
The Analysis page for Frank Stella (Artfacts 2016a), that is accessible as a trial to the 
subscription service, reveals more information on awarded points. He received 1,360.77 
415
Inf Retrieval J (2018) 21:410–448 
1 3
points for 25 exhibitions in 2016. Again, there are no details on the points for each exhibi-
tion but only the average, minimal, medial and maximal points of exhibitions. Subscribers 
can only get insight on whether an artist tends over the years to participate in more exhibi-
tions or not and whether the average exhibition value increases or decreases. Furthermore, 
no details can be found for the remaining points up to the total 11,530.82 Frank Stella 
received in 2016.
Analysis pages also provide statistics and graphs that illustrate an artist’s exhibition his-
tory by: (1) the different types of art institutions (e.g. festivals, galleries, museums, etc.), 
(2) the type of exhibitions (i.e. solo or group), (3) ranking over years and finally (4) a peer 
group analysis. The peer group represents artists who usually exhibit collectively in group 
shows. Its analysis correlates the ranking evolution for artists in the same group.
In conclusion, Artfacts.Net might have some limitations but currently it is the only ser-
vice that provides an artist ranking based on data different than auction sales. Subsequently, 
it is the only service that ultimately ranks artists in the primary market.
3 Mining social media for market data
The review of the available art information services makes it apparent that just like for any 
other market, the actors in the art world require information, data analysis and statistics. 
Art buyers behave just like any other buyer; they are looking to maximize their gains. The 
main distinction is that art buyers not only wish to maximise monetary gain but also non-
monetary gain from the aesthetic and social values inherent in artworks, that is the cultural 
value as explained in Sect. 2.
A recent research topic is mining social media data to forecast stock market behavior. 
Most such approaches mine data for specific firm stocks or indexes and employ senti-
ment analysis or clustering techniques to forecast the daily stock market behavior or stock 
return, risk and stock comovement (Bollen et al. 2011; Oliveira et al. 2013; Liu et al. 2015; 
Smailovic et al. 2013; Arias et al. 2014). The notion behind these approaches is that the 
general public mood is correlated with stock market behavior.
All the above mentioned approaches for estimation and forecasting cannot be directly 
applied to the art market since there are no publicly available price data. Furthermore, as 
it has already been stated in Sect. 2, an artwork as a product possesses cultural values, that 
affect its price, mostly inherent with the artist’s recognition and appreciation by the art 
world. Thus, it is proposed to mine social media data to estimate the inherent cultural val-
ues of an artist’s name. The closest analogous to this is measuring brand equity, awareness 
and perceptions. Hence, the suggestion to treat artists as brands for this study.
A brand’s equity value infers intangible aspects like perceived quality, customer loy-
alty and satisfaction. Recently, more than a few methodologies have been presented that 
measure a brand’s equity value with the utilization of social media data mining. Following, 
the equity value is often used to estimate a firm’s stock market behavior (Yu et al. 2013). 
Chung (2015) mine Twitter data to determine the adjectives used to describe a brand and 
its products. Tucker (2015), He et al. (2013) collect product reviews from Twitter and uti-
lize sentiment analysis to classify them as positive or negative to ascertain equity value. 
Other approaches obtain product reviews from other social media to predict stock market 
performance based on equity value (Luo et al. 2013). Similar approaches have also been 
used for measuring a city’s brand equity value (Andéhn et al. 2014).
416
Inf Retrieval J (2018) 21:410–448
1 3
Overall, the foundation of all the above mentioned methodologies is that they attempt 
to extract the wider possible public opinion for a brand and its products. Their main differ-
ences lie in the particular approaches used to collect data, clean data, estimate sentiment 
and finally in which ways the public opinion will be exploited for price or other estimates.
Yet again, the approaches for brand equity estimation cannot be directly applied to the 
art market since only the opinion of certain elite groups are important in the social con-
struction of cultural value.
A quite different approach is presented by Culotta and Cutler (2016) to mine brand per-
ceptions from Twitter. The authors wish to correlate brands with specific attributes (e.g. 
eco-friendliness). Instead of mining tweets about the specified attribute, a user network is 
built that is relevant to the attribute. Then, the brand’s correlation to the attribute is deter-
mined as the correlation of its follower’s with the user network. Topic specific user net-
works will be exploited in our proposed methodology as it will be later detailed in Sect. 5.
Subsequent sections of this paper will detail the proposed social media data mining 
methodology that takes into consideration the particularities of the art market.
4 Data collection and cleaning
4.1 Data collection
Currently there are numerous social media sites, each one of them with a different set of 
characteristics and features for their users. For our study, we will mine data from Twitter. 
Twitter is a microblogging service with over 300 million users (Statista 2016), who post 
short messages, up to 140 characters. Twitter posts are appropriate for our research due to 
the large number of publicly available messages and their predominantly textual nature.
Twitter offers developers access to data through three different APIs. The Twitter Search 
API (Twitter Inc. 2016d) allows to retrieve tweets posted during the last 7 days using 
search criteria (e.g. keywords, usernames, etc.). Approximately 500 million tweets are gen-
erated each day and Twitter imposes certain limitations on the amount of data that can be 
retrieved (Twitter Inc. 2016a) for the safety of their infrastructure but also because Twitter 
does not want to offer publicly all user data. A developer is limited to making 180 search 
requests in a 15 min period. Each search query for a specific keyword returns approxi-
mately the most recent 5000 tweets.
The Twitter Sample Streaming API (Twitter Inc. 2016c) provides tweets as they happen 
in near real-time. Again, API users can specify the keywords they wish to track. Hence, the 
streaming API will return in real-time tweets that are relative to the specified keywords. 
However, the main drawback is that it only provides a small random sample of the total 
tweets; in most cases 1–2% of the total tweets generated. This percentage is dependent on 
the actual popularity of the tracked keywords.
Finally, the third way to access Twitter data is by the Twitter Firehose (Twitter Inc. 
2016b). The Twitter Firehose is very similar to the Twitter Sample Streaming API only 
that it guarantees that it will return in near real-time the 100% of generated tweets that 
match the specified criteria. However, the Twitter Firehose is not free as it is available only 
through Twitter’s enterprise API platform GNIP.

In our implementation data were collected daily from July 11th 2016 to November 11th 
2016 through the Twitter Search API with the utilization of the Tweepy library for Python 
(Roesslein 2016). Data were collected for the 548 unique artists included in the Artprice 
Top 500 in 2015 (AMMA & artprice.com 2016) and the Artfacts.Net Top 100 (Artfacts 
2016b). The Artprice ranking is based on factual auction revenue data and therefore it 
refers only to the secondary market. The Artfacts.Net ranking is the only one available that 
utilizes data other than auction sales, measurements on exhibition success, and therefore 
includes some evidence on the primary market although its precision cannot be assessed as 
it was discussed in Sect. 2.1.1. Hence, it was decided to include all 500 artists in the Art-
price ranking and the top 100 artists in the Artfacts ranking to subsume an adequate sample 
of artists that might be successful only in the primary market but not in the secondary. This 
will allow us to evaluate the results of our approach against both rankings as well as with 
regard to the primary and secondary market. Additionally, the proposed methodology for 
the construction of a topic-specific user network will be evaluated as to how well it repre-
sents Twitter mentions for these 548 artists.
Every day Twitter was searched for posts that included the name
2
of each one of the 
548 artists considered in our study. The total number of tweets retrieved daily is shown in 
Fig. 1. To overcome some of the limits imposed by the Twitter Search API, a pagination 
technique was utilized (Twitter Inc. 2016f). Due to the nature of the Twitter Search API 
there were fetched retweets for which the original tweet was not retrieved. A procedure was 
implemented where the missing original messages were requested. In this manner, the total 
number of retrieved messages were further increased by approximately 10%.
In total, over 2.6 million tweets were retrieved from approximately 1 million unique 
users. It should be noted that the search was limited in tweets written in English. None-
theless, this does not affect the global nature of our search since users most often write 
posts in English, even if they are located in a non-English speaking country, when they 
want to comment something that overreaches the interest of the local public. The 2.6 
million retrieved tweets are associated with 150 unique countries. The country field in a 
Tweet object (Twitter Inc. 2016e) as retrieved from the Twitter API is not always present.

The Twitter Search API returns tweets from all users that include the search string either in plain text or a 
hashtag.

Nevertheless, we still can get an indication about the validity of our statement that even 
though we search only for tweets written in English our search reflects the global mentions 
of an artist’s name.
4.2 Data cleaning
One of the main difficulties when mining tweets for specific keywords is to verify which 
tweets are actually relevant. This problem arises due to word polysemy but also particularly 
in our study due to synonymy.
Since we search for tweets that mention an artist’s name the problem of synonymy 
becomes central. A representative example is with the search for the artist Claudio Bravo 
which also returned a significant number of tweets about the famous football player Clau-
dio Bravo. Cases like this one inflict a serious integrity problem to the collected data.
Typically in such cases topic modelling techniques are utilized for polysemy disam-
biguation. In essence, topic modelling techniques analyze plain-text documents for seman-
tic structure. This is achieved by representing a corpus of documents as sparse vectors on 
which statistical techniques are applied to find word co-occurrence patterns that represent 
a topic. Popular algorithms for topic inference include the Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) 
(Hofmann 1999) and the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) (Blei et al. 2003).
Although the above mentioned topic modelling techniques have been applied success-
fully to numerous applications, the same does not hold when applied to short tweets. Since 
these techniques rely on word frequencies, it is anticipated that it will be hard to infer 
which words will be more correlated in each short text (Hong and Davison 2010). Further-
more, it is also hard to deduce the context of a short message for polysemy or synonymy 
disambiguation.
Quite a few approaches are present in the literature that attempt to alleviate the identi-
fied problems with topic modelling in short messages (Weng et al. 2010; Cheng et al. 2014; 
Zhao et al. 2011). In our implementation we employed the approach presented by Weng 
et al. (2010) where tweets posted by each individual user are aggregated into a single docu-
ment. This methodology overcomes the deficiencies of short texts as noted previously and 
is one of the most popular currently in the literature. Although the authors applied tweet 
aggregation to identify the topics a user is interested into, we will apply it to identify the 
topic of a tweet.
After tweets were aggregated into documents for each unique user, topic modelling was 
performed with the LDA implementation of the Gensim library for Python (Rehurek and 
Sojka 2010). The latest dump of all English Wikipedia articles (Wikipedia 2016) was uti-
lized as a training corpus. Then, similarity queries for each document against the identified 
Wikipedia topics were performed.
As it was expected this methodology worked well in cases a user had made enough 
posts. For example, the user Man City News (@mcnewsmcfc), from whom 277 tweets 
were retrieved, was correctly identified with a football related topic. Hence, all 277 tweets 
by this user can be disregarded since it is now certain that they do not mention Claudio 
Bravo the artist. The same holds for a personal Twitter account whose 286 tweets were 
retrieved when querying about the artist Christo. LDA correctly identified this user to a 
topic related to video games since this account’s posts were talking about Christo the char-
acter from the video game Disgaea 5: Alliance of Vengeance.
419

1 3
The setback with the tweet aggregation methodology is that it cannot work well for all 
retrieved tweets. This is due to the fact that almost 70% of the unique users, whose tweets 
were retrieved, have posted only a single tweet. As a result, the aggregation methodology 
would not improve LDA results for topic identification. The aforementioned percentage 
of users with only a single tweet is significantly higher than the stated 15% in the study of 
Weng et al. (2010).
Intuitively, this could be explained as the result of the common habit to mention very 
well-known artist names to comment on circumstances unrelated to the art world. For 
example, when querying about Vincent van Gogh a tweet was fetched with the text “bruh i 
swear i just seen vincent van gogh on the train” by a personal Twitter account who posted 
only this single tweet regarding van Gogh. However, 11,229 retweets of this post were also 
retrieved. This number of retweets could affect significantly our later evaluation of how 
often van Gogh is mentioned if they are not correctly identified as not relevant.
Thus, we will next present a new methodology for evaluating a tweet’s topic relevance 
based on the originating user’s position in a topic-specific network of users.
5 Topic‑specific network of users for topic modelling and user influence 
estimation
As we have already described in Sect. 2, the art market is elitist. Therefore, not all opinions 
are equally significant in deciding what is important or of high value in the art world. This 
perception has to be accounted in the construction of the topic-specific network of users.
In the retrieved tweets, there are many occasions where the name of a very well-known 
artist is used to describe something that is not necessarily pertinent to the purpose of our 
study. For example, quite a few twitterers comment on plastic surgeons by using Picasso as 
a reference. One such tweet is: “Never go to a plastic surgeon with pictures of Picasso on 
his office wall.”. This type of tweets undoubtedly do not infer valuable insight on the inher-
ent cultural value of an artist’s name. The only information we can extract from tweets like 
these is that certain artists are well-known to the general public. The difficulty in estimat-
ing an artist’s cultural value is further deepened by the frequent tweets with well-known 
artists’ quotes or titles of widely recognized artworks. In most cases tweets like these is a 
mean of expressing a user’s personal feelings.
As we have already stated, in this study we propose to treat artists as brands; for which 
similar methodologies to ours have been used to measure brand awareness or brand equity. 
Although, the previously mentioned type of tweets would still be valuable in the case of 
brands, as wide recognition is typically desired, in the elitist art world wide recognition is 
not necessarily commended.
Consequently, the topic-specific network of Twitter users will be structured in an 
elitist manner to reflect the art world. Our methodology for the construction of the elit-
ist topic-specific network was stimulated by the notion of exemplar Twitter users used by 
Culotta and Cutler (2016). The authors attempted to find individuals or organizations that 
are strongly affiliated with a specific attribute (e.g. eco-friendliness) so that they later can 
assess the perceived relationship between a brand and this attribute.

term followees will be used to denote this group of users.
–

5.2 Selection of the exemplar twitter accounts
Culotta and Cutler (2016) utilized an automated methodology for determining the exem-
plar Twitter accounts. Users included in more than two Twitter Lists,
3
both relative to a 
specific topic, are selected as exemplar users.
This approach was assessed but it was proven inappropriate for our study. Twitter lists 
related to the general topic of fine arts do not reflect the desired elitist nature. These lists 
mostly contain the Twitter accounts of widely recognized museums, galleries and artists. 
Hence, a manual approach was adopted to select a relatively small set of exemplar Twitter 
accounts.
We utilized the following lists of the most influential people and organizations in the art 
world as they were determined by established magazines and art news websites:
– 
ArtReview Power 100 (ArtReview 2015, 2016)
– 
artnet news 100 Most Influential People in the Art World (artnet news 2015, 2016)
– 
Artsy The 20 Most Influential Young Curators in the United States (Gotthardt 2016)
– 
Artsy The 20 Most Influential Young Curators in Europe (Bier 2016)
– 
Artsy The 15 Most Influential Art World Cities of 2015 (Artsy 2015)
The Twitter accounts of the people and organizations included in the above lists were 
manually entered into the set of exemplar Twitter accounts, E. Finally, the set of exem-
plar Twitter accounts resulted with a size of 
|E| = 287
. The complete list of all exemplar 
accounts is shown in “Appendix 1”. The exemplar set is comprised of Twitter accounts of 
museums, galleries, art fairs, art news websites and magazines, auction houses, art founda-
tions, curators, collectors, artists as well as art project spaces. The distinctive factor of the

utilized lists when compared to Twitter lists is that they include the most influential entities 
instead of the most widely recognized. Following, the set of exemplar users will function 
as the initial seed for populating the user network.
5.3 Collection of the exemplars’ followees and followers
All Twitter accounts that each exemplar Twitter account, 
E
i
is following are collected and 
form the set 
F
E
, the followees. The resulting size of this set is 
|F
E
| =
17,645. This size rep-
resents the unique users that all exemplar Twitter accounts are following.
The set 
O
E
was also constructed by collecting the followers of each exemplar Twit-
ter account. Exemplar accounts with more than 200,000 followers were excluded from 
this procedure. As it will be explained in the next Section, the expertise of a follower is 
inversely proportional to the total number of an exemplar’s followers. Consequently, fol-
lowers of such exemplar accounts cannot offer significant expertise or influence and there-
fore are disregarded.
The unique collected followers of all exemplar Twitter accounts are 
|O
E
| =
2,419,865. 
It can be immediately noticed that there is a great difference in the size of 
|F
E
|
and 
|O
E
|
. 
In general, opinion-makers are expected to have a large number of followers (Leavitt et al. 
2009). The number of followers of a user indicates the size of the audience for that user 
and it is commonly termed as the indegree of a user (Cha et al. 2010). Given that exemplar 
Twitter accounts were manually selected as the most influential people and organizations 
in the art world it is anticipated that many of them would have a large number of followers. 
Conversely, the number of other accounts a given user is following is commonly termed as 
the outdegree of a user.
In Fig. 2 the correlation between followees and followers of exemplar Twitter accounts 
is shown. It can be observed that there are a few outliers regarding the number of their 
followers or followees. The Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) in New York and the Tate 
Galleries are included in the most visited art museums in the world with millions of annual 
visitors. The great extent to which these accounts surpass the indegree of all other exem-
plar Twitter account confirms the tendency of Twitter users to follow widely recognized

entities (Liu et al. 2014). Twitter accounts with such followers to followees ratio are termed 
as content generators or opinion makers. Accounts with a number of followees propor-
tional to their followers are termed as conversationalists (Leavitt et al. 2009). This term 
signifies that they are more interested in engaging into conversations rather than pushing 
content to other users. Then, as the number of a Twitter account’s followees grows and 
tends to exceed its number of followers, it demonstrates a behavior of a listener rather that 
of a content generator. Finally, users with a near equal number of followees and followers 
are usually spammers. Spammers aggressively follow other users to take advantage of the 
common habit of Twitter users to follow back their followers. The insights behind the num-
ber of followers and followees of a Twitter account will next be utilized to evaluate a user’s 
topic expertise and influence.
5.4 User topic expertise evaluation
In almost every methodology present in the literature for the estimation of a user’s topic 
expertise or influence, a recursive bottom-to-top approach is utilized (Gayo-Avello 2013). 
This is because it is attempted to deduce which users own the maximum expertise. Con-
versely, in our methodology maximum expertise users in the constructed network are 
known a priori. They are the exemplars which were manually selected for this very pur-
pose. Hence, an inverse top-to-bottom approach is utilized for the topic expertise evalua-
tion since the maximum expertise of exemplars will be transferred to all its followees and 
followers in the manner that is detailed next.
The topic expertise, 
T
u
, for all users 
u ∈ E ∪ F
E
∪ O
E
is in the range [0,1]. Initially, the 
topic expertise of exemplar Twitter accounts is set to the maximum value equal to 1.
Next, the topic expertise of the accounts that exemplars are following, the followees 
F
E
, will be determined by a weighted voting scheme. The notion behind the choice of a 
weighted voting scheme is that when an exemplar Twitter account follows another account, 
it is like voting that this other account is of similar expertise with itself. Furthermore, the 
behavior of an exemplar in following other users will be taken into consideration when 
their power of vote will be assigned. Hence, exemplars that are more selective in who they 
choose to follow will be given more voting power. This way the elitist nature of the user 
network will be preserved. The total votes each followee receives will determine its topic 
expertise.
Formally, the voting power of each exemplar, 
W
E
i
, is determined by:
The use of the ratio of followers, 
|O
E
i
|
, to followees, 
|F
E
i
|
, is drawn from Leavitt et al. 
(2009) where it was utilized to characterize a Twitter’s account behavior as an opinion 
maker, a conversationalist, a listener or a spammer.
Table 1 gives some descriptive examples that illustrate how the voting power is distrib-
uted among exemplars. The Museum of Contemporary Art Tokyo is the exemplar with the 
highest voting power and the Museo Rufino Tamayo the one with the lowest. The first is 
highly selective in following other accounts. The latter has more followees than followers 
which makes it a listener rather than an opinion maker. It must also be noted that Saatchi 
Gallery has a voting power very close to the one of Alexandra Munroe and Hirshhorn

Museum although the number of their followees and followers are of different magnitude. 
However, Saatchi Gallery is the exemplar with the highest number of followees which 
makes it highly unselective.

Following, the topic expertise of each exemplar followee, 
T
F
i
E
, is evaluated as the sum 
of all votes casted by exemplars, 
E
′
⊆ E
, that follow 
F
i
E
. The total number of followees of 
all exemplars, 
|F
E
|
is used as a normalization factor, so that topic expertise values are in the 
range [0, 1].
In Table 2, some representative examples of the evaluated topic expertise are shown that 
validate the proposed methodology. As it can be seen there are quite a few Twitter accounts 
that their expertise was evaluated close to 1, that is almost the expertise of exemplars.
A similar procedure with the above, a weighted voting scheme, will be exploited for the 
determination of the topic expertise for the followers of exemplar Twitter accounts, 
O
E
.
An ingoing following connection to an exemplar account is regarded of less importance 
than an outgoing connection. Any Twitter account can follow another one without the need 
of an approval or confirmation. Thus, most Twitter users, that are not opinion makers, typi-
cally follow others than being followed (Liu et al. 2014), i.e. they have more followees 
than followers. They decide to follow a Twitter account in a casual manner without neces-
sarily denoting that they really want to read every post they make or that they have genu-
inely mutual interests (Cha et al. 2010). For example, 3.53 million users follow the Twitter 
account of the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA). It is not realistic to anticipate that all 3.53 
million users are genuinely interested in modern art or in everything that MoMA posts.
The votes that each exemplar will cast for its followers will signify a vote of confidence 
in their mutual interest on the topic. Voting power is set to be inversely proportional to the 
number of followers. This is analogous to the notion that a Twitter account’s influence or 
expertise on the topic is distributed evenly among all of its followers (Gayo-Avello 2013). 
Formally, the voting weight of each exemplar,

equal.

ers of exemplars is shown. As it can be observed, accounts @ManuelGiraudier and @FIAC 
have the highest expertise since they mainly followed accounts that are not widely recog-
nized and possess a higher voting power. On the other hand, although account @e_flux fol-
lows almost half the exemplar accounts its expertise is lower. Accounts like @AnaVFCH,

5.5 User topic influence evaluation
Many of the methodologies present in the literature measure influence in a user network 
with metrics similar to the ones we utilized previously for the topic expertise evaluation 
(Leavitt et al. 2009; Gayo-Avello 2013). Certainly, a user’s expertise and influence are 
highly correlated. Besides, many studies conclude that measuring influence in a topic spe-
cific network is more accurate than globally (Weng et al. 2010). In the context of our study, 
we are only interested in an elitist topic-specific network of users. That is, a network that 
will include a rather limited number of users with maximum expertise rather than a net-
work that attempts to be as complete as possible. Moreover, as it was defined in Sect. 2, 
we are seeking to evaluate the socially constructed aesthetic and social values integrated in 
an artist’s name. In conclusion, the proposed user topic influence evaluation will endeavor 
to measure the user’s contribution to the social construction of aesthetic and social values.
Cha et al. (2010) state that there are three activities that represent different types of 
influence: 
indegree influence 
the number of followers of a user. However, it was found to indicate 
the user’s popularity rather than its ability to engage audience.
retweet influence 
the number of retweets that contain one’s name. It indicates the ability 
to generate content.
mention influence 
the number of mentions that contain one’s name. It indicates the abil-
ity to engage in conversations.
They also conclude that retweets are driven by the content value of a tweet and men-
tions are driven by the name value of the user. Thus, the aesthetic value will be associated 
with retweet influence and the social value with mention influence.

In Table 4, the exemplar accounts with the highest retweet and mention influence are 
shown. It can be observed that an account’s influence is not directly relevant to its number 
of followers. Tate and MoMA have approximately the same number of followers but their 
influence is significantly different. Furthermore, retweet and mention influence are also not 
directly relevant. For example, Saatchi Gallery has a a high number of retweets but on the 
other hand an unexpectedly low number of mentions. However, it should be stressed out 
that influence measurements stemmed from the collected set of 2.6 million tweets related 
to the specific 548 artists considered in our study. Hence, the presented influence metrics 
are relative to those specific artists that represent only a fragment of the art world.
In Tables 5 and 6, the retweet and mention influence of followees and followers of 
exemplar accounts is shown. In both cases, there are accounts that were evaluated with a 
very low topic expertise that exhibit the highest influence. Such accounts are content gen-
erators; they have many followers and post many tweets. For example, the History chan-
nel’s twitter account posts quite often quotes and stories about very well-known artists and 
many of its 1.5 million followers tend to retweet these posts. On the other hand, numerous 
users share links to YouTube videos related to artists with Twitter posts where they also 
tend to mention the name of YouTube’s twitter account. Hence, the high retweet influence 
of the History channel and the high mention influence of YouTube. Though, in our study 
retweet and mention influence is utilized to determine the aesthetic and social value. Con-
sequently, the total aesthetic and social influence,

, for each user 
u ∈ E ∪ F
E
∪ O

will be

Previous sections described the proposed methodology for an artist ranking system that 
included the following steps:
– 
collect Twitter posts by any user that mention any of the 548 artist names considered in 
our study,
– 
clean retrieved tweets with the use of the LDA topic inference algorithm with aggrega-
tion,
– 
construct a topic-specific user network comprised of manually selected exemplar Twit-
ter accounts as well as their followees and followers,
– 
evaluate users’ expertise in the network
– 
evaluate users’ influence in the network
Following, the artist rankings that resulted from our proposed methodology will be pre-
sented and discussed to validate the main goal of the proposed system. Namely, to estimate 
the inherent cultural value of an artist’s name in an elitist manner, i.e. the more often an 
artist is mentioned by users of high expertise and influence the higher the estimated inher-
ent cultural value.
Initially, in Sect. 6.1 rankings based only on the frequency of all retrieved tweets will be 
shown. These rankings will serve as a reference for comparison with the rankings presented

in Sect. 6.2, where only tweets from users in the topic-specific network are utilized for 
ranking. Furthermore, the effect of gradually increasing the considered user expertise is 
shown. Finally, in Sect. 6.3 the effect in rankings of weighing the importance of tweets, 
according to evaluated users’ influence is shown.
In all rankings only the top 20 artists will be shown for clarity purposes.
6.1 Artist ranking based on LDA with aggregation
Initially, the artist ranking based only on the frequency of all retrieved tweets is shown. In 
Table 7, the ranking based on the tweet frequency of all retrieved tweets is presented as 
well as after the LDA topic inference algorithm with aggregation is applied as described in 
Sect. 4.2.
When the LDA with aggregation methodology was applied almost 75% of retrieved 
tweets were rejected as irrelevant. It is not unusual for such a big percentage of data to be 
rejected after topic modelling is applied (Weng et al. 2010). In Sect. 4.2, the main issues 
related to word polysemy and synonymy that lead to redundant retrieved data were high-
lighted. Indicative examples on the reasons for rejecting a great number of tweets after the 
LDA with aggregation algorithm is applied are:
– 
synonymy of the artist Claudio Bravo with the footballer,
– 
synonymy of the artist Christo with the video game character,
– 
news media tweets reporting the retrieval of stolen van Gogh paintings,
– 
Yoko Ono tweets related to her work as a musician.
Nevertheless, there are still noisy data present in the ranking after LDA with aggrega-
tion is applied. For example, there is still a significant number of tweets related to Claudio 
Bravo the footballer that could not be identified as sports related. This is mainly due to the 
significant number of users that have posted only a single tweet; in which case the LDA 
with aggregation cannot perform well. Thus, Claudio Bravo moves down only two posi-
tions in the ranking; Yoko Ono moves down five positions; Christo is no longer in the top 
20 and van Gogh still remains in the first position.
In the following section, to eliminate noisy data only tweets from users in a topic-spe-
cific network are considered.

6.2 Artist ranking based on the evaluated user expertise
The process for the construction of a topic-specific user network was detailed in Sect. 5. 
Initially, a set of manually selected exemplar accounts is created to represent the most 
important users in the art world since our goal is to build an elitist user network as it was 
described in Sect. 5.2. Then, the user network construction is completed with the collection 
of the followees and followers of exemplar accounts.
In Fig. 3, the ranking based on the frequency of retrieved tweets only from users in the 
topic-specific network is shown. It can be observed that Claudio Bravo is no longer present 
in the top 20 since almost all retrieved tweets were referring to the footballer. Many of the 
van Gogh related tweets regarding the news about the retrieval of his stolen paintings were 
not by users in the network and therefore not evaluated in the ranking. Thus, now he holds 
the 3rd position. Many other differences can be also observed in the current ranking:
– 
Salvador Dali, Edgar Degas, Francis Bacon and Gustav Klimt move down over seven 
positions in the ranking,
– 
Edvard Munch, Yoko Ono, Jackson Pollock and Man Ray are no longer present in the 
top 20,
– 
Jeff Koons, Ai Weiwei, David Hockney, Paul Klee, Marcel Duchamp and Yayoi 
Kusama enter the top 20.
The total number of tweets considered in this ranking was further reduced by 54%. 
However, only 92 artists are not mentioned at all from the constructed topic-specific user 
network. These 92 artists were mentioned in only 1512 tweets out of the total 2.6 million 
originally retrieved. Hence, we can deduce that the topic-specific network produces a reli-
able sample data set of tweets for our study.
Moreover, the utilization of the topic-specific user network provides a valuable insight 
on what type of users mostly tweet about each artist. It is apparent in Fig. 3 that the high-
est volume of tweets is from followers since they are the most populous group of users. 
It is most interesting though to notice that followers post predominantly about the most 
widely recognized artists: Picasso, Warhol and van Gogh. This validates our claim while 
constructing the user network that followers are of lesser importance than followees of 
exemplars. Therefore, it can be said that the set of followers represents the general public 
opinion in the art world.

Following, in Figs. 4, 5 and 6 the artist ranking is shown when tweets only from users 
with an evaluated expertise of over 0.3, 0.5 and 0.7, respectively, are considered. It can be 
observed that as the user expertise raises, the contribution of followers in the ranking is 
almost eliminated whereas the exemplars’ contribution becomes authoritative. This aspect 
is highly desired while evaluating artist rankings, in view of the already highlighted fact 
that the art world is elitist.
Furthermore, it can be noticed that as the considered user expertise raises the artists 
present in the ranking is significantly different. There are only 7 artists present both in the 
ranking with tweets from users with an expertise of over 0.7, shown in Fig. 6, and the rank-
ing after LDA with aggregation was applied, shown in Table 7. There are important dif-
ferences even when the later shown rankings that consider tweets from users in the topic-
specific network is considered. This feature further highlights the fact that different type of 
users talk about different artists.
In conclusion, it can be observed that the higher considered user expertise the less 
widely recognized artists are present in the ranking who are mentioned by users in a casual 
manner and not due to an event occurring in the art world with impact. Therefore, artists 
like Rembrandt, Dali and Kandinsky are not present in Figure’s 6 ranking whereas artists 
like Agnes Martin, Cindy Sherman and Gerhard Richter enter it. Certainly, there are other 
widely recognized artists still present, but some of them indeed still own greater cultural

value that is reflected on either auction revenue or exhibition success. For example, Warhol 
and Picasso occupy the 1st and 3rd position in the final ranking shown in Fig. 6. They also 
occupy the first two positions in both Artprice and Artfacts rankings. These two artists 
may probably be the ones that almost everybody recognizes but they also have the great-
est auction revenue according to Artprice and the greatest exhibition success according to 
Artfacts.
In the following section, the evaluated influence for each user in the topic-specific net-
work is also utilized to determine artist rankings. Hence, the effect of the type of users that 
talk about artists is further enhanced in rankings.
6.3 Artist ranking based on the evaluated user expertise and influence
The user influence was evaluated using the retweet and mention count as described in 
Sect. 5.5. In this study, user influence is exploited to suggest the inherent cultural val-
ues (aesthetic and social) in an artist’s name. Thus, the influence of a twitterer is used to 
pose the importance of a tweet in terms of cultural value. Hence, not all tweets contribute 
equally when counting the frequency of tweets that mention an artist’s name. The scaled 
user influence, 
I
u
, is used to weight the importance of a tweet.
In Fig. 7, the artist ranking based on the influence of retrieved tweets from all users in 
the topic-specific network is given. The obtained ranking is almost identical to the one

shown in Fig. 3 where only the frequency of retrieved tweets from all users in the topic-
specific network was considered. In this case, the impact of influence is minimal due to 
high volume of evaluated tweets by followers.
When we compare the rankings only from users with an evaluated expertise of over 0.3 
based on influence, shown in Fig. 8, with the ones based on frequency, shown previously in 
Fig. 4, the following key observations can be made:
– 
Vincent van Gogh moves to the 1st place. The van Gogh Museum had a high number of 
retweets and mentions due to the news about the retrieved stolen paintings. This led into 
an evaluation of high influence. Furthermore, since the van Gogh Museum is an artist 
dedicated museum it posts tweets about van Gogh daily.
– 
Wifredo Lam and Georgia O’Keeffe appear in the ranking. Tate Modern organized 
periodic exhibitions for both artists that opened while data were collected for our study. 
Tate Modern is the user with the highest influence and made many posts about these 
exhibitions which were also retweeted by numerous other users in the network.
When the influence only from users with an expertise of more than 0.5, shown in Fig. 9, 
no significant changes can be observed in the ranking. However, when an expertise of more 
than 0.7 is considered, shown in Fig. 10, it can be noticed that:

– 
Vincent van Gogh moves back to the 5th position. The van Gogh Museum’s expertise 
was evaluated just under 0.7 and therefore its tweets do not contribute to the ranking. 
Thus, only what other users post is evaluated to rank van Gogh.
– 
Yoko Ono is no longer present in the top 20. Yoko Ono has a personal Twitter account 
that exists in the user network as a followee of exemplars. Her account’s expertise was 
also evaluated just under 0.7 and therefore posts originating from her own account are 
not considered in the evaluation.
Furthermore, when rankings in Figs. 6 and 10 are compared, in which only tweets from 
high expertise users are considered but in the latter tweets are also weighted according 
to user influence, it can be observed that Ed Ruscha, Gerhard Richter, Alex Katz, Marcel 
Duchamp and Jeff Koons have been replaced by Wifredo Lam, Georgia O’ Keeffe, Robert 
Rauschenberg, Nan Goldin and Gustav Klimt. Although, the former artists are still placed 
in quite high positions in the ranking, positions 20–30, they have been outranked by the 
latter artists as more influential users tweeted about them. For example, Wifredo Lam has 
tweets about his concurrent exhibitions in October 2016 at Tate Modern and Philips Auc-
tion as well as tweets by Sotheby’s about a sale of one his works at 1.1m shortly before the 
opening of his retrospective at Tate Modern. On the other hand, Ed Ruscha was tweeted 
by less influential users mainly about a screening of the only two films he ever created at 
MOCA Los Angeles, his exhibitions at the de Young Museum, the Crown Point Press Gal-
lery and the Gagosian Gallery London as well as about a sale of one his works at $18,750 
by Sotheby’s. Another representative example is that of Jeff Koons and Robert Rauschen-
berg. Jeff Koons was mentioned more often by from less influential users mainly about his 
participation in The Met’s online series The Artists Project, a lawsuit regarding one of his 
sculpture’s, laying off half of the painters working at his studio as well as announcements 
for auctions of some of his works at Doyle Auctions and Heritage Auction. On the other 
hand, Robert Rauschenberg was tweeted by more influential users due to his exhibitions at 
Tate Modern, MoMA New York, San Francisco MoMA as well as the Ullens Center for 
Contemporary Art (UCCA) in China.
To conclude, the desired features of an elitist ranking system, as stated in the begin-
ning of this paper, are evident in the presented results when a high expertise and influ-
ence of users are considered. The effect of general comments and widely recognized artist 
name mention has been limited. On the other hand, the effect of mentions from authorita-
tive users is augmented where they are mainly initiated from exhibition events. Undoubt-
edly, certain limitations have also been identified that will be discussed in the following 
Sections.
6.4 Comparison with other rankings
The proposed ranking system will be compared against two well known rankings: the art-
price Top 500 artists by auction revenue in 2015 (AMMA & artprice.com 2016) and the 
Artfacts.Net Top 100 (Artfacts 2016b). However, a direct comparison cannot be performed. 
The foremost cause is that the data utilized in these two rankings refer to different periods 
of time. Our data were collected for a duration of 4 months, from July 2016 to November 
2016. The artprice ranking refers to auction sales data in 2015 and the artfacts ranking to 
accumulated data up to the beginning of 2016. Consequently, data collected for a much 
436
Inf Retrieval J (2018) 21:410–448

longer period of time are required to be able to make a direct comparison that refers to the 
same time period.
Nonetheless, a qualitative comparison against the other two rankings will be attempted. 
In Table 8, the percentage of artists for which the proposed system collected enough data 
and was able to rank them is shown for each period of art.

Initially, it should be noticed 
that the artfacts and artprice rankings are very different. The artfacts Top 100 is comprised 
of artists primarily from the Post-War and Contemporary art period. On the other hand, in 
the artprice ranking almost half of the artists are from the Modern Art period. As it has 
been noted in the beginning of this paper, in Sect. 2, the primary and secondary art market 
are different in many ways and this is reflected in the two rankings. The proposed system 
collected enough data and was able to rank 63% of the artists included in the artfacts Top 
100 but only 23.40% of the ones included in the artprice ranking.
It should also be noted that it is common to both Artprice and Artfacts rankings that 
contemporary artists, i.e. artists that were born after 1945, do not dominate the top 20 posi-
tions. In the Artprice ranking there are only two contemporary artists present in the top 
20 positions. This is expected since Artprice is focused on the secondary market. On the 
other hand, in the Artfacts ranking that utilizes measurements of exhibition success more 
contemporary artists are present in the top 20 positions, specifically six. Finally, in the final 
ranking of the proposed approach, shown in Fig. 10, there are five contemporary artists 
present (Ai Weiwei, Jean-Michel Basquiat, Cindy Sherman, Nan Goldin, Banksy). In con-
clusion, it is common in the art world that artists from older periods of art dominate the top 
20 positions in rankings either due to auction revenue or exhibition success.
There are two key properties that enable the proposed system to rank an artist: the 
retrieved data and the type of users that belong in the topic-specific user network. Con-
sequently, more research is required to deduce whether a different network of users or 
different type of data are required for the secondary art market considered in the artprice 
ranking. An important factor that needs also to be considered is that China accounted for 
30% of the annual action revenue in the global Art Market (AMMA & artprice.com 2016). 
However, almost all major Chinese auction houses do not have a Twitter account and as a

– 
Old Masters: works by artists born before 1760.
– 
19th Century Art: works by artists born between 1760 and 1860.
– 
Modern Art: works by artists born between 1860 and 1920.

result the users interested in these auctions were not represented in the constructed topic-
specific network.
On the other hand, most of the artists present in the artfacts Top 100 were ranked by 
the proposed system. More importantly, the discussion of the results in Sect. 6.3 provides 
evidence that the proposed system ranks artists based on their exhibition success as it is the 
case with the artfacts ranking system. In Table 9, the artfacts and artprice ranking is shown 
for the artists present in the top 20 of the proposed system illustrated in Fig. 10 when the 
evaluated user expertise and influence are considered. The common characteristic of all 
rankings is that Andy Warhol and Pablo Picasso are in the top positions. In general, for 
other artists there is a great difference in the position they occupy in each ranking. This is 
expected since the artprice ranking is based on auction turnover, the artfacts on exhibition 
success and the proposed system measures exhibition success by means of reputation suc-
cess. Moreover, each ranking utilizes data from a different period of time.
Nevertheless, the case of the artist Banksy should be pointed out. Banksy is a street 
artist and although he has international recognition and a significant auction turnover that 
places him in the artprice ranking, he appears in an extremely low position in the artfacts 
ranking, the 4113th position. As the case of Banksy is discussed in Periferic Biennial 
(2008), his very low position in the artfacts ranking is due to the different type of art he 
makes that is not well represented in the registered exhibition spaces and data in the art-
facts database. It is promising that the proposed system was able to rank more appropri-
ately Banksy since influential users talk about his work although he does not hold exhibi-
tions in established museums or galleries.
Another example is the case of Nan Goldin who is ranked in a high position in the 
artfacts ranking but is not present in the artprice top 500. Again in this case the proposed

system ranked Nan Goldin appropriately although her annual auction turnover is not as 
high but she is appreciated and recognized in the primary market.
As a result, the presented preliminary results are very promising since they exhibit the 
ability of the proposed system to collect data and measure the reputation and success of 
artists from a diverse collection of sources that originate from different periods of art as 
well as different art practices. More data have to be collected though, for a long time period 
of at least a year, to be able to make a more direct comparison with the other two rankings.
In conclusion, the proposed system can offer two main advantages over the other con-
sidered ranking systems. The first one is that it can provide rankings that reflect the pre-
sent time. The two other systems update their rankings quarterly or even yearly due to the 
demanding process of manually collecting data. The proposed system is able to continu-
ously integrate newly collected data into the rankings. Additionally, it is also able to pre-
sent rankings based on accumulated data over time or only on data collected during a spec-
ified period of time that is of interest. Certainly, if rankings for instance based on monthly 
obtained data are observed there will be high fluctuations. This will occur since rankings 
will reflect only where the short-term attention of the art world is. However, as obtained 
data will be accumulated over larger periods of time, e.g. a whole year or even a 5-year 
period, these fluctuations will be limited, as it is the case with the Artfacts ranking where 
data are accumulated from long periods of time (in some cases since 1996). In this case, 
rankings will reflect the long-term attention of the art world.
The other significant advantage the proposed system can exhibit is that it can provide 
detailed insights on how rankings were evaluated. For the calculation of rankings, a tweet’s 
importance is scaled according to the user’s influence. Therefore, tweets that contribute 
significantly in an artist’s ranking can be identified. These tweets will infer insights on the 
events and the users that largely impacted each artist’s ranking. Thus, the potential user of 
the system can further evaluate the presented rankings based on his/her specific interests.
7 Conclusions and future work
In this paper, a social data mining methodology was proposed to rank artists. The proposed 
ranking system takes into account the singularities of the art market. The main difficulties 
and differentiations of the art economy when compared to other economies are summa-
rized below:
– 
there are no publicly available price data,
– 
the market value of an artwork is dependent on its inherent cultural value,
– 
the cultural value is socially constructed by elite social groups with higher cultural sta-
tus or higher purchasing power,
– 
the features and structure of the primary and secondary art market are different in many 
ways.
The main goal of the proposed system is to mine social data to obtain trend estimates for 
the art market. Based on the singularities of the art market, the main goal becomes to esti-
mate the inherent cultural value of an artists name, since market value and cultural value 
are interdependent. Thus, the obtained rankings represent artists with the highest estimated 
cultural value which could be reflected in the market value of their artworks. As such, 
obtained artist rankings can also be viewed as art market trends.

Estimates of cultural value, that is socially constructed by elite social groups, are pro-
vided by measuring how often an artist is mentioned by users of high expertise and influ-
ence. The proposed elitist topic-specific user network determines the expertise and influ-
ence of users and was shown that it can reflect the elitist nature of the art world. The 
evaluated user expertise incorporates into rankings that the attention an artist receives 
from the art world is important rather than wide recognition from the general public. Fur-
thermore, when the evaluated user influence is also incorporated into rankings, reputation 
within the art world is esteemed. The contribution of the general public opinion for widely 
recognized artists was minimized whereas the contribution of certain influential users was 
authoritative for the final artist ranking determination.
A comparison with two other ranking systems was performed to highlight the advan-
tages of the proposed methodology as well as topics for further research and improvement. 
The proposed methodology has provided evidence that it can collect data, estimate cul-
tural value and rank a great variety of artists that originate from different periods of art 
as well as different art practices. However, it was deduced that it cannot represent well all 
the characteristics that govern the secondary market and especially the Chinese art market. 
Conversely, promising results were indicated regarding the measurement of exhibition suc-
cess that largely governs the primary art market. The accuracy of the exhibition success 
measurement cannot be evaluated since there is no “ground truth” available. Other ways for 
evaluation, possibly with the participation of art market experts, will have to be considered 
in the future.
Two main advantages of the proposed system were identified. The first one is that it does 
not rely on manual collection of data to estimate rankings, as it is the case with other sys-
tems currently available. Hence, rankings can be updated continuously to signify current 
trends in the art market. The second core advantage is that potential users of the system can 
explore the events that had the greatest impact on ranking results for further assessment 
based on their particular interests.
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to mine social media to extract 
quantitative and qualitative data for the art market. This study being preliminary in a novel 
application undoubtedly requires further research in a number of identified topics. Firstly, 
more data have to be collected for a longer period of time and for a larger number of art-
ists to further validate the obtained results. A reverse procedure should also be investigated 
where all exemplars’ tweets are retrieved and artist mentions are detected, thus evaluation 
of rankings is not limited to artists included in a predetermined list.
The selection of which users are regarded as exemplars governs greatly the structure 
of the user network and consequently the obtained rankings. Therefore, alternative ways, 
automated or semi-automated, for the initial setup of the set of exemplar accounts have 
to be explored. The objective of exemplar accounts is to represent as closely as possible 
experts in the art world. However, not all art world experts are Twitter users and those 
who are exhibit an online behavior different than the one in the real world. Although some 
may be highly influential in the art world their online presence is limited and thus not well 
represented in mined data. Another issue identified is the potential bias that can affect 
rankings from accounts that predominately post about themselves (e.g. artist’s personal 
accounts, artist dedicated museums).
Consequently, 
alternate 
approaches 
for 
user 
expertise 
and 
influence 
measurement 
should be considered to investigate their performance on the previously identified issues. 
Firstly, other metrics than retweet and mention count should be incorporated for influence 
evaluation as well as ranking evaluation. An example would be how many different users 
posted for an artist. Another approach would be to continuously reassess the expertise and

influence of users, either in the user network or not, while collecting new tweets. This 
approach would result in an adaptive user network structure. Thus, being able to include 
new expert and influential users as well as determining their main characteristics. This 
approach could also contribute to the identification of the distinctive characteristics of the 
secondary market that are not currently well represented in the proposed methodology.
Finally, further research for the development of a formal model for the construction of 
elitist user networks based on topic expertise is essential for the application of the proposed 
approach to other markets.
