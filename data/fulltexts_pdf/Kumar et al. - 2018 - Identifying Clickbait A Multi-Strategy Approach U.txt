ABSTRACT
Online media outlets,
in a bid to expand their reach and subse-
quently increase revenue through ad monetisation,
have begun
adopting clickbait techniques to lure readers to click on articles.
The article fails to fulfill the promise made by the headline. Tradi-
tional methods for clickbait detection have relied heavily on feature
engineering which, in turn, is dependent on the dataset it is built
for. The application of neural networks for this task has only been
explored partially.
We propose a novel approach considering all
information found in a social media post. We train a bidirectional
LSTM with an attention mechanism to learn the extent to which
a word contributes to the post’s clickbait score in a differential
manner.
We also employ a Siamese net to capture the similarity
between source and target information. Information gleaned from
images has not been considered in previous approaches. We learn
image embeddings from large amounts of data using Convolutional
Neural Networks to add another layer of complexity to our model.
Finally, we concatenate the outputs from the three separate com-
ponents, serving it as input to a fully connected layer. We conduct
experiments over a test corpus of 19538 social media posts, attaining
an F1 score of 65.37% on the dataset bettering the previous state-of-
the-art, as well as other proposed approaches, feature engineering
or otherwise.

INTRODUCTION
The Internet provides instant access to a wide variety of online
content,
news included.
Formerly,
users had static preferences,
gravitating towards their trusted sources, incurring an unwavering
sense of loyalty. The same cannot be said for current trends since
users are likely to go with any source readily available to them.
In order to stay in business,
news agencies have switched,
in
part, to a digital front. Usually, they generate revenue by (1) adver-
tisements on their websites, or (2) a subscription based model for
articles that might interest users. However, since the same informa-
tion is available via multiple sources, no comment can be made on
the preference of the reader. To lure in more readers and increase
the number of clicks on their content, subsequently increasing their
agency’s revenue, writers have begun adopting a new technique -
clickbait.
The concept of clickbait is formalised as something to encourage
readers to click on hyperlinks based on snippets of information
accompanying it,
especially when those links lead to content of
dubious value or interest. Clickbaiting is the intentional act of over-
promising or purposely misrepresenting - in a headline, on social
media, in an image, or some combination - what can be expected
while reading a story on the web.
It is designed to create and,
consequently, capitalise on the Loewenstein information gap [
11
].
Sometimes, especially in cases where such headlines are found on
social media, the links can redirect to a page with an unoriginal
story which contains repeated or distorted facts from the original
article itself.
Our engine is built on three components.
The first leverages
neural networks for sequential modeling of text.
Article title is
represented as a sequence of word vectors and each word of the
title is further converted into character level embeddings. These
features serve as input to a bidirectional LSTM model. An affixed
attention layer allows the network to treat each word in the title in
a differential manner. The next component focuses on the similarity
between the article title and its actual content. For this, we generate
Doc2Vec embeddings for the pair and act as input for a Siamese net,
projecting them into a highly structured space whose geometry

reflects complex semantic relationships. The last part of this system
attempts to quantify the similarity of the attached image, if any,
to the article title.
Finally,
the output of each component is con-
catenated and sent as input to a fully connected layer to generate a
score for the task.

RELATED WORK
The task of automating clickbait detection has risen to prominence
fairly recently.
Initial attempts for the same have worked on (1)
news headlines, and (2) heavy feature engineering for the partic-
ular dataset.
[
3
]’s work is one of the earliest pieces of literature
available in the field, focusing on an aggregation of news headlines
from previously categorised clickbait and non-clickbait sources.
Apart from defining different types of clickbait, they emphasise on
the presence of language peculiarities exploited by writers for this
purpose. These include qualitative informality metrics and use of
forward references in the title to keep the reader on the hook. The
first instance of detecting clickbait across social media can be traced
to [
15
], hand-crafting linguistic features, including a reference dic-
tionary of clickbait phrases, over a dataset of crowdsourced tweets
[
14
]. However, [
4
] argued that work done specifically for Twitter
had to be expanded since clickbait was available throughout the
Internet, and not just social networks.
It was not until [
1
] that neural networks were tried out for the
task as the authors used the same news dataset as [
4
] to develop a
deep learning based model to detect clickbait. They used distribu-
tional semantics to represent article titles, and BiLSTM to model
sequential data and its dependencies. Since then, [
18
] has also exper-
imented with Twitter data [
14
] deploying a BiLSTM for each of the
textual features (post-text, target-title, target-paragraphs, target-
description,
target-keywords,
post-time) available in the corpus,
and finally concatenating the dense output layers of the network be-
fore forwarding it to a fully connected layer. Since it was proposed
in [
2
], the attention mechanism has been used for a variety of text-
classification tasks, such as fake news detection and aspect-based
sentiment analysis. [
20
] used a self-attentive BiGRU to infer the im-
portance of tweet tokens in predicting the annotation distribution
of the task.
One common point in all the approaches yet has been the use
of only textual features available in the dataset.
Our model not
only incorporates textual
features,
modeled using BiLSTM and
augmented with an attention mechanism, but also considers related
images for the task.

MODEL ARCHITECTURE
In this section, we present our hybrid approach to clickbait detec-
tion. We first explain the three individual components followed by
their fusion, which is our proposed model. These components are (1)
BiLSTM with attention, (2) Siamese Network on Text Embeddings,
and (3) Siamese Network on Visual Embeddings. An overview of
the architecture can be seen in Figure 1.
We start with an explanation of the features used in the first
component of the model.
Distributed Word Embeddings
Considering the effectiveness of distributional semantics in mod-
eling language data, we use a pre-trained 300 dimensional Word2Vec
Figure 1:
Model Architecture
[
12
] model trained over 100 billion words in the Google News cor-
pus using the Continuous Bag of Words architecture. These map
the words in a language to a high dimensional real-valued vectors
to capture hidden semantic and syntactic properties of words, and
are typically learned from large, unannotated text corpora. For each
word in the title, we obtain its equivalent Word2Vec embeddings
using the model described above.
Character Level Word Embeddings
Character level word embeddings [
7
] capture the orthographic
and morphological features of a word. Apart from this, using them
is a step toward mitigating the problem of out-of-vocabulary (OoV)
words. In such a case, the word can be embedded by its characters
using character level embedding. We follow [
1
] and first initialize a
vector for every character in the corpus. The vector representation
of each word is learned by applying 3 layers of a 1-dimensional
Convolutional Neural Network [
5
] with ReLU non-linearity on each
vector of character sequence of that word and finally max-pooling
the sequence for each convolutional feature.
Document Embeddings
Doc2Vec [
10
] is an unsupervised approach to generate vector
representations for slightly larger bodies of text, such as sentences,
paragraphs and documents. It has been adapted from Word2Vec
[
12
] which is used to generate vectors for words in large unlabeled
corpora. The vectors generated by this approach come handy in
tasks like calculating similarity metrics for sentences, paragraphs
and documents. In sequential models like RNNs, the word sequence
is captured in the generated sentence vectors. However, in Doc2Vec,

1226
the representations are order independent. We use GenSim [
16
] to
learn 300 dimensional Doc2Vec embeddings for each target descrip-
tion and post title available.
Pre-trained CNN Features
As seen in various visual understanding problems recently, image
descriptors trained using Convolutional Neural Networks over large
amounts of data such as ImageNet have proven to be very effective.
The implicit learning of spatial layout and object semantics in the
later layers of the network from very large datasets has contributed
to the success of these features.
We use a pre-trained network
of VGG-19 architecture [
17
] trained over the ImageNet database
(ILSVRC-2012) and extract CNN features. We use the output of the
fully-connected layer (FC7), which has 4096 dimensions, as feature
representations for our architecture.
We now go into detail about the components of the model, indi-
vidual and combined, and how the parameters are learned.
3.1
Bidirectional LSTM with Attention
Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) is a class of artificial neural net-
works which utilizes sequential information and maintains history
through its intermediate layers. A standard RNN has an internal
state whose output at every time-step which can be expressed in
terms of that of previous time-steps. However, it has been seen that
standard RNNs suffer from a problem of vanishing gradients [
9
].
This means it will not be able to efficiently model dependencies and
interactions between words that are a few steps apart. LSTMs are
able to tackle this issue by their use of gating mechanisms. For each
record in the dataset, the content of the post as well as the content
of the related web page is available. We convert the words from
the title of both attributes into the previously mentioned types of
embeddings to act as input to our bidirectional LSTMs.

Finally, we are left with the task of figuring out the significance
of each word in the sequence i.e. how much a particular word in-
fluences the clickbait-y nature of the post.
The effectiveness of
attention mechanisms have been proven for the task of neural ma-
chine translation [
2
] and it has the same effect in this case. The goal
of attention mechanisms in such tasks is to derive context vectors
which capture relevant source side information and help predict
the current target word. The sequence of annotations generated
by the encoder to come up with a context vector capturing how
each word contributes to the record’s clickbait quotient is of para-
mount importance to this model. In a typical RNN encoder-decoder
framework [
2
], a context vector is generated at each time-step to
predict the target word. However, we only need it for calculation
of context vector for a single time-step.

3.2
Siamese Net with Text Embeddings
The second component of our model is a Siamese net [
13
] over
two textual features in the dataset. Siamese networks are designed
around having symmetry and it is important because it’s required
for learning a distance metric. We use them to find the similarity
between the title of the record and its target description. The words
in the title and in the target description are converted into their
respective Doc2Vec embeddings and concatenated,
after which
they are considered as input into a Siamese network.
A visual
representation of this can be found in the middle of Figure 1.
3.3
Siamese Neural Network with Visual
Embeddings
The final component of our hybrid model is also a Siamese net.
However, it considers visual information available in the dataset,
and sets our model apart from other approaches in this field. The
relevance of the image attached to the post can be quantified by
capturing its similarity with the target description. The VGG-19
architecture outputs a 4096 dimensional
vector for each image
which, in turn, is fed as input into a dense layer to convert each
representation to a 300 dimensional vector. This serves as one input
to the visual Siamese net. The target description is converted into
its 300 dimensional vector representation by passing it through the
pre-trained Doc2Vec model, which acts as the second input for the
network. It is the rightmost part of Figure 1.
3.4
Fusion of the components
To combine the components and complete our hybrid model, the
output from each of the three parts is concatenated and subse-
quently acts as input for a fully connected layer. This layer finally
gives as its output the probability/extent that a post, together with
its related information, can be considered clickbait.

Learning the Parameters
We use binary cross-entropy as the loss optimization function for
our model. The cross-entropy method [
6
] is an iterative procedure
where each iteration can be divided into two stages:
(1) Generate a random data sample (vectors,
trajectories etc.)
according to a specified mechanism.
(2) Update the parameters of the random mechanism based on
the data to produce a "better" sample in the next iteration.

EVALUATION RESULTS
The model was evaluated over a collection of 19538 social media
posts [
14
], each containing supplementary information like target
description, target keywords and linked images. We performed our
experiments with the aim of increasing the accuracy and F1 score
of the model. Other metrics like mean squared error (MSE) were
also considered.
4.1
Training
We randomly partition the training set into training and validation
set in a 4:1 ratio. This ensures that the two sets do not overlap. The
model hyperparameters are tuned over the validation set. We ini-
tialise the fully connected network weights with the uniform distri-
bution in the range
−
p
6/(f anin + f anout )
and
p
6/(f anin + f anout )
[
8
]. We used a batch size of 256 and adadelta [
19
] as a gradient based
optimizer for learning the parameters of the model.
4.2
Comparison with other models
In Table 1, we compare our model with the existing state-of-the-art
for the dataset used and other models which have employed similar
techniques to accomplish the task.
Calculation and comparison
across these metrics was conducted on TIRA [
15
], a platform that
offers evaluation as a service. It is clear that our proposed model
outperforms the previous feature engineering benchmark and other
work done in the field both in terms of F1 score and accuracy of
detection.
5
CONCLUSION
In this work,
we have come up with a multi-strategy approach
to tackle the problem of clickbait detection across the Internet.
Our model
takes into account both textual
and image features,
a multimedia approach, to score the classify headlines. A neural
attention mechanism is utilised over [
1
] to improve its performance,
simultaneously adding Siamese nets for scoring similarity between
different attributes of the post. To build on this approach, we would
like to explore better image embedding techniques to better relate
it to the article.
